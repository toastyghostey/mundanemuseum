            <p><b>To us, mundane is far from boring.</b></p>
            <p>The boundaries of the mundane world have been met time and time again, and it's these same boundaries that tie all human experience together to create something truly special.</p>
            <p>It is through seeing the lives of those long past that we can truly gain a form of appreciation for life as a form of art itself.</p>
